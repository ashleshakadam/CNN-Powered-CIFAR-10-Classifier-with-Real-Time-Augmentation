# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This repository presents a rigorous implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Through methodical experimentation and disciplined engineering, this project achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining transparency and reproducibility.

- **Objective:** Develop and evaluate a robust CNN to classify 60,000 32×32 color images into 10 semantic categories.  
- **Dataset Details:** CIFAR-10 comprises 50,000 training and 10,000 test images across 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  
- **Key Contributions:**  
  1. Comprehensive data normalization and one-hot encoding pipeline  
  2. On-the-fly data augmentation (random flips, translations) to enhance generalization  
  3. Custom three-block CNN architecture with dropout regularization  
  4. Empirical hyperparameter tuning using Adam optimizer and learning-rate scheduling  
  5. Modular, reproducible Jupyter Notebook workflow  

## Architectural Summary
```text
Input (32×32×3)
→ [Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3×3) → ReLU
   → Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3×3) → ReLU
   → MaxPooling(pool_size=2×2) → Dropout(rate=0.25)] × 3
→ Flatten
→ Dense(units=512) → ReLU → Dropout(rate=0.5)
→ Dense(units=10) → Softmax

	•	Activation: ReLU
	•	Regularization: Dropout (25% in conv blocks; 50% before final dense)
	•	Loss & Optimizer: Categorical Crossentropy + Adam (default LR)

Installation & Setup
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ashleshakadam/CNN-Powered-CIFAR-10-Classifier-with-Real-Time-Augmentation.git
cd CNN-Powered-CIFAR-10-Classifier-with-Real-Time-Augmentation


	2.	(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


	3.	Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage
	1.	Launch Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook


	2.	Open CIFAR-10_Image_Classification.ipynb and execute cells in order:
	•	Data loading & preprocessing
	•	Model definition
	•	Training & validation
	•	Evaluation & visualization

Results & Evaluation
	•	Test Accuracy: ≥ 90% on the 10,000-image test set
	•	Training Dynamics: Loss and accuracy curves exhibit stable convergence and minimal overfitting

# Example evaluation snippet
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

Extensibility
	•	Integrate deeper architectures (ResNet, DenseNet)
	•	Automate hyperparameter search via Bayesian optimization
	•	Implement k-fold cross-validation for robustness
